Automated Web3 Bug Detection — Powered by **Chain-Fox**, stored securely on **0G**

---

## Overview

**0g-bug-tracker** is an open-source platform for automated detection, reporting, and tracking of Web3-related bugs. It leverages AI-enhanced static and dynamic analysis to identify vulnerabilities in decentralized systems, including smart contracts, dependencies, and modular infrastructure.

Deployed live at: [https://reports.chain-fox.com/](https://reports.chain-fox.com/)
Source code: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Chain-Fox/0g-bug-tracker)

## Powered By

* **Chain-Fox** ([https://www.chain-fox.com/](https://www.chain-fox.com/)) — Provides AI-driven security research, automated bug detection, and expertise in decentralized ecosystems.
* **0G** ([https://0g.ai/](https://0g.ai/)) — Supplies modular storage, compute, and chain infrastructure for scalable, verifiable, and tokenized security services.

---

## Technology

The **0g-bug-tracker** platform integrates multiple layers of analysis to detect, store, and report Web3 bugs:

* **Static Analysis** — Detects potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts and code dependencies without execution.
* **Dynamic Analysis** — Observes live behaviors and interactions, flagging runtime issues such as deadlocks, reentrancy, and race conditions.
* **Automated Reporting** — Bugs are classified by severity, type, and root cause, with code references and suggested fixes.
* **Integration with 0G** — Detection datasets and audit reports are stored verifiably on 0G Storage, while compute-heavy pre-deployment checks are offloaded to 0G Compute nodes.
* **Tokenized Security-as-a-Service** — Optional on-chain audit verification and incentive-driven reporting for contributors.

---

## Types of Bugs Detected

The system currently identifies:

* **Concurrency Issues**: Deadlocks, race conditions, double locks in RWMutex usage.
* **Blocking Channel Misuse**: Mismanaged Go channels causing potential hangs.
* **Data Corruption Risks**: Improper locking or unverified writes in storage systems.
* **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Reentrancy, unsafe calls, and state inconsistencies.

Automated bug detection helps catch subtle and hard-to-reproduce issues that manual audits often miss.

---

## Why Automated Analysis Matters

* **Speed & Coverage**: Analyze thousands of dependencies and contracts faster than manual audits.
* **Consistency**: Apply reproducible detection rules across projects and deployments.
* **Early Prevention**: Identify critical issues before deployment, reducing risk in production.
* **Data-Driven Security**: Aggregate insights to refine detection rules and fine-tune AI models.

## Integration with 0G

**Vision & Alignment**
We are building a self-optimizing, AI-driven security layer for the Web3 stack, aligned with 0G’s goal of democratizing AI. By leveraging 0G’s Storage, Compute, and Chain, we can:

* Store verifiable detection data and audit reports.
* Offload compute-intensive pre-deployment analyses.
* Provide tokenized, incentive-driven security services for 0G projects.

**Tokenized Security-as-a-Service**

* **Pay-per-check audits**: Users pay small token fees to run pre-deployment checks.
* **On-chain reports**: Optional audit reports stored verifiably on 0G Storage.
* **Discounts for 0G projects**: Reduced audit costs for native deployments.
* **Free baseline analysis**: Early 0G projects receive free pre-deployment checks.
* **Researcher incentives**: Reward detection quality and contributions from external developers.
